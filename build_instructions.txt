The Ubuntu-PPA somehow doesn't find the jags-4.0.0 dependency and won't build:

If anyone knows how to fix this please let me know...

One solution is to roll back to an older JAGS version. If you do need the 
current 4.x version, no worries: the jags-wiener module is compatible, but needs
 to be installed manually as follows.

- Download the latest source tarball:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/jags-wiener/files/JAGS-WIENER-MODULE-1.1.tar.gz/download

- Then do the following steps:
$ tar xvzf JAGS-WIENER-MODULE-1.1.tar.gz
$ cd JAGS-WIENER-MODULE-1.1
$ sudo apt-get install -y autoconf automake libtool g++ && autoreconf -fvi
$ ./configure --prefix=/usr
$ make && sudo make install

- That's it

Sorry for the inconvenience!
